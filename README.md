# Coding-Quiz-

Project description:


In this project I created a code-related quiz using JavaScript. The user is given 75 seconds to complete the quiz, each question that is answered incorrectly deducts 10 seconds off the time remaining and a prompt will indicate whether the answer is correct or not. Once the final question is answered or the time runs out the game will end. Once the game is over a new page opens indicating the score. The user can input their initials and view their high scores. Anytime time during the game the user is able to click the home button and return to the original page.
